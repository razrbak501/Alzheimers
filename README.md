# Alzheimers
Dementia is defined as a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer’s is a degenerative brain disease that is caused by complex brain changes following cell damage. It leads to dementia symptoms that gradually worsen over time. (“Dementia Vs. Alzheimer’s Disease: What Is the Difference?” n.d.) Two of my grandparents died with several of the signs of dementia but never had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. <br>

In this analysis, we’ll discuss several research questions and attempt to glean some incites from the data.
- What are the main risk factors for developing this disease?
- Are there any secondary risk factors?
- Is Alzheimer’s disease becoming more common?
- Is it possible to predict who might develop this disease? <br>
To answer these questions, we’ll perform an analysis of the data to determine the significant correlation between risk factors to determine which factors may be considered major versus minor. If the data is available, a similar approach will be taken to determine if there is a correlation within families. To determine if different ethnicities are more or less at risk, analyzing positive cases as a percent of the total ethnic population will be reviewed. <br>
To determine if the disease is becoming more common, I plan to plot the positive diagnosis numbers against the general population over time to see if variables are increasing at similar rates or if they are not connected. With the information above, we may be able to show which groups are more at risk of developing the disease.
